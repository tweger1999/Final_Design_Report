1. Tristan - Determine what kind of machine learning method to use (supervised, reinforcement, unsupervised, transfer, etc.)
2. Tristan - Investigate how to partition data into training, validation and test subsets.
3. Tristan - Run the clustering algorithm using the different data subset partitions.
4. Tristan - Select a cross validation method to get a more accurate rating of the performance of each model.
5. Tristan - Interpret the clustering results and make adjustments if needed.
6. Ryan - Determine optimal amount of vector space reduction that can be achieved without losing anything above minimal classification data.
7. Ryan - Decide methodology of dimension reduction and document rationale behind choice.
8. Ryan - Actual implementation of dimension reduction.
9. Ryan - Compare application results when reducing to different numbers of dimensions.
10. Ryan - Document if the optimal number of dimensions is relatively consistent across different document embedding techniques.
11. Ryan - Design quality and informative visualizations for reduced 2D vector space.
12. Ryan - *Potential. Employ different method/tool in order to reduce dimensions. Convey whether results remain consistent or differ.
