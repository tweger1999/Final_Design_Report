# Project Name: Creating Semantic Spaces using Document Clustering
## Project Topic Area: Machine Learning, NLP
## Description: In the present day, there exists a wide range of software tools intended to draw meanings from texts. This project aims to expand upon these existing tools to encompass significantly longer text sizes. Our work will implement and analyze performances of determining this meaning by breaking the corpus into either: 1. Words, 2. Sentences, 3. Paragraphs, or 4. Documents.
