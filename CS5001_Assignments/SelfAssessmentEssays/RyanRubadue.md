## Self Reflection - Ryan Rubadue

## What Went Well

Throughout much of the beginning of the semester much of my focus beyond the deliverables for this course was directed towards gaining an understanding in the project area. One thing I feel I did well was being thorough in this research towards gaining a significant understanding of semantic text analysis including existing tools, the overall process, and exactly how our project relates to this. Additionally, I felt I did a good job of properly coordinating tasks with the other group members as well as being available for any questions/discussions that arose. 

## What Can Be Improved

One thing that I could have done more of especially towards the beginning of the semester is properly documenting the work I complete for the project. While overall, I was able to adequately complete work, more thorough documentation would have been helpful for a retrospective on the timeline of work done. Another improvement I believe our team as a whole can strive to work on is code documentation. Currently, as there is not a significant portion of code related to the project this is manageable, but especially as the codebase grows I believe it is important to maintain a properly formatted and documented code repository.

In a general sense, I feel confident in my ability to effectively contribute to a successful demo/completion of our project goals going forward into winter break and spring semester.

## Team Collaboration

Throughout the semester, I felt there was a healthy mix of individual work I accomplished to the work that our team collaborated on.
In making decisions relative to the overall scope of the project I closely collaborated with the other team members as well as coordinated with our advisor. 
Our team utilized a group chat as the primary means of communication and the other members were very responsive and willing to help any time I encountered
issues or had any questions. Meetings held with other members yielded productive results and helped my overall understanding of the project. Overall, I feel confident in our team's ability to work together. 

Our advisor is extremely well-versed in our project area and has been very helpful in guiding our progress throughout the semester. Meeting have generally been held once or twice per month to discuss progress and relay the team's questions. I feel overall our advisor is doing a great job in being a mentor for the project. One barrier I feel exists to a degree is that the other two team members have our advisor for multiple classes this semester and know him on a much more personal level. However, they have done a great job of relaying any questions or small discussions they have with him face-to-face during their classes.

## Retrospective on Work Completed

As of the end of this semester, I feel our team has achieved a relatively good portion of what we set out to do for the project. As initially intended, a large portion of the actual project implementation will be completed over winter break and throughout the spring semester. With our members being new to the project area (in a relative sense), much of this semester was gaining a proper understanding and the knowledge to be confident we can be successful in the project area. From a personal perspective, I am overall satisfied with the work I have produced this semester. 

## Overall Project Outlook

From the start of the project I have been passionate about the area and work our team is doing. At this point, I believe the project is challenging but do-able and has real-world applications. From a technical sense, I initially had a different idea on the overall outlook of the project prior to speaking with the team's advisor towards the beginning of the semester. During the semester, I continually gained confidence in the direction the project is going up to this point where I can say I am confident going forward with the project's development and am excited for our team to dive into much more of the project implementation in the coming months.
